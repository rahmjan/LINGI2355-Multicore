- [ ] Implement the four hash-based sets and test them extensively using unit tests. *(link to your code)*


- [ ] For each configuration, produce a plot that shows the throughput in operations per second (average and standard deviation). Explain the performance and scalability of the different set flavors, and the potential impact of resizings. *(link to your four plots in PDF, and explanations of the plots in the [Report.md](Report.md) file)*
