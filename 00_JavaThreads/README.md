## Introduction

In this series of practical sessions we will cover the basics of working with Threads and built-in high-level synchronization primitives in Java, and setup our work environment for future practical sessions, including the use of multicore machines available from INGI.

Each markdown document contains an introduction to the concepts together with questions.
We recommend you create a separate Markdown file with your answers rather than updating the provided instructions directly: if we are to make changes to the instructions, you could have conflicts when merging the corresponding upstream changes.
You can name this file `Report.md`.

The session is in four parts.
You must follow this order:
- [CreatingThreads.md](CreatingThreads.md): basics of creating and running threads in Java.
- [Monitors.md](Monitors.md): using the Java built-in monitor model.
- [Locks.md](Locks.md): explicit reentrant locks and condition variables.
- [Environment.md](Environment.md): accessing the Burattini INGI server.
- [Testing.md](Testing.md): running measurements and assessing the scalability of our algorithms.
